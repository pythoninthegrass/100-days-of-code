# Coding Journal (n√©e 100-days-of-code)

## Description
> I'm looking more for a good example of content and format of a repo where someone logs their daily progress  
> I'm not looking for tools one could use - I'm looking for actual examples of coding journals done well  
‚Äî [Kimberly](https://techlahoma.slack.com/archives/C015RSYBWF3/p1657138354330209) (2022-07-06)  

We hear you, Kimberly. Until those tools exist and/or are found, this'll have to do.

## Setup
* Navigate to [the repo](https://github.com/pythoninthegrass/100-days-of-code) ‚Äî you already nailed this step üî®
* Select _Use this template_
* Create a new repo of your choosing
  * Defaults are fine
  * Public should keep you accountable, but baby steps
* After a new repo has been created, select _Code_
  * Clone > Local > HTTPS
  * Copy the URL
  * Clone via the terminal (cf. [Git Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/git/))
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/git
    git clone https://github.com/username/100-days-of-code.git
    ```
* Install either [Notable](https://notable.app/) (free) or [Typora](https://typora.io/) (one-time fee of $15)
  * I prefer the latter, but we'll demo with Notable

## Usage
* Work on something [programming-related](http://100daysofcode.com/)
* Open Notable
* Change Data Directory > Select `~/git/100-days-of-code/notes`
![Select the edit icon](img/01_select_folder.png)
* Select the edit icon (‚úèÔ∏è) on the menu bar  
* Read up on [Github Flavored Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
* Jot down some notes from your day  
![Write something](img/02_markdown.png)  
* Click the pencil again to stop editing  
![Marvel at your masterpiece](img/03_pretty.png)  
* Commit to your repo
    ```bash
    git status
    git add notes/log_1.md
    git commit -m "Create log_1.md" -m "First day of 100 days of code!! üéâ"
    git push -u origin main
    ```
* Rinse/repeat x100. (At least!)

## BONUS
* Regenerate the 100 template markdown files ([Ubuntu Linux](https://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2021/01/install-python-3-10-alpha-ubuntu-20-04-ubuntu-18-04/) example)
  * See: [macOS](https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html) and [Windows](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html) instructions for installation
    ```bash
    # update repos, install python repo source, update repos, install python3.10.*
    sudo apt update \
    && sudo apt install software-properties-common -y \
    && sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa -y \
    && sudo apt update \
    && sudo apt install python3.10 -y

    # clone repo
    mkdir -p git
    cd git/
    git clone https://github.com/pythoninthegrass/100-days-of-code.git
    cd 100-days-of-code/

    # install python dependencies
    mkdir -p ~/.local
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

    # temporarily add `~/.local` python binaries to shell path
    export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"

    # check existing markdown notes
    ls -l notes/

    # remove all markdown notes
    rm -rf notes/*.md

    # regenerate notes
    cd app/
    python3 main.py
    cd -

    # check fresh copies
    ls -l notes/
    cat notes/log_1.md
    ```

## TODO
**MVP**
* ~~100 copies for each day with boilerplate~~
* `README.md`
  * Use template
  * Edit in desktop app (~~Notable~~, Typora, VSCode, etc)
  * ~~Inspiration/links for getting started~~

**Stretch Goals**  
* ~~Automate with a programming language and document as day one (of thousands lmao)~~
  * Don't use python for ^^ üêç
  * And/or use ~~python~~ and go
